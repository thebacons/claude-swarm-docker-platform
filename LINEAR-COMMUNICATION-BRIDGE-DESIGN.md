# Linear as AI Agent Communication Bridge - Design Document

## 🎯 Core Concept: Linear as the "Project Memory"

Unlike Redis (ephemeral) or PostgreSQL (low-level), Linear provides:
- **Persistent, structured communication** that survives container restarts
- **Human-readable audit trail** of all agent activities
- **Visual progress tracking** for dashboard integration
- **API-driven automation** with webhooks for real-time events

## 📊 Communication Patterns

### 1. Task-Based Agent Coordination
```
Policeman creates parent issue: "Build User Authentication"
├── Sub-task 1: "Design auth API" → Assigned to Developer-2
├── Sub-task 2: "Create login UI" → Assigned to Developer-1
├── Sub-task 3: "Write auth tests" → Assigned to Tester (blocked by 1 & 2)
└── Sub-task 4: "Integration test" → Assigned to Policeman (blocked by 3)
```

Each agent watches their assigned tasks and Linear's blocking relationships naturally orchestrate the workflow.

### 2. Status-Driven Triggers
- Developer-1 moves task to "In Review" → Webhook triggers Tester
- Tester moves task to "Failed Testing" → Developer gets notified
- All tasks reach "Done" → Policeman triggers integration phase
- Custom statuses like "Awaiting AI Review" for agent handoffs

### 3. Comment-Based Agent Dialogue
```
Developer-1: "Login component complete. Used React Hook Form for validation."
Tester: "Found XSS vulnerability in email field. See attached test report."
Developer-1: "Fixed in commit abc123. Ready for retest."
Tester: "All security tests passing. Approved."
```

## 🔄 Advanced Coordination Patterns

### 1. Swarm Progress Tracking
When Policeman spawns 15 agents for parallel work:
- Parent issue: "Refactor Codebase to TypeScript"
- 15 sub-issues created, each tracking one file/module
- Real-time progress bar on dashboard showing completion
- Automatic rollup of sub-task statuses to parent

### 2. Intelligent Work Distribution
```python
# Policeman's decision logic
if task.labels.contains("frontend"):
    assign_to = "Developer-1"
elif task.labels.contains("backend"):
    assign_to = "Developer-2"
elif task.labels.contains("requires-testing"):
    create_linked_issue(assignee="Tester", blocks=task)
```

### 3. Quality Gates via Linear
- Each task must have: `tested`, `reviewed`, `documented` labels
- Tester adds `tested` label after validation
- Policeman only merges when all labels present
- Dashboard shows quality metrics per cycle

## 📡 Real-Time Integration Possibilities

### 1. Webhook-Driven Architecture
```
Linear Webhook → API Gateway → Agent Action
├── Issue created → Policeman analyzes and distributes
├── Status changed → Relevant agent activated
├── Comment added → Agent reads and responds
└── Label added → Trigger specific workflows
```

### 2. Bidirectional Sync
- Agents update Linear in real-time
- Linear webhooks trigger agent actions
- Dashboard subscribes to Linear GraphQL for live updates
- Git commits automatically linked to Linear issues

## 💡 Unique Communication Advantages

### 1. Cross-Container Context Sharing
Unlike file-based communication, Linear provides:
- Global visibility of all work across containers
- Rich metadata (priority, estimates, attachments)
- Relationship tracking (blocks, relates to, duplicates)

### 2. Intelligent Batching
```
Tester: "I have 10 similar bugs in the login flow"
→ Creates one parent issue with 10 sub-issues
→ Developer-1 can fix systematically
→ Progress tracked at both levels
```

### 3. Time-Based Coordination
- Use Linear cycles for "sprint" planning
- Agents work on current cycle tasks only
- Automatic cycle rollover with incomplete task handling
- Historical velocity tracking for AI improvement

## 🚀 Advanced Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Stage Validation Pipeline
```
Code Complete → Unit Tests → Integration Tests → Security Scan → Performance Test
     ↓              ↓              ↓                ↓                ↓
  Linear Status   Auto-trigger   Auto-trigger    Auto-trigger    Final Approval
```

### 2. Collaborative Debugging
- Developer hits blocker → Creates issue with "help-needed" label
- All agents can see and contribute solutions
- Policeman can reassign or spawn specialist agent
- Resolution documented for future AI learning

### 3. Dependency Management
- Frontend waiting for API → Tracked via Linear blocking
- Automatic notifications when blockers resolved
- Visual dependency graph on dashboard
- Intelligent scheduling based on dependencies

## 🎨 Dashboard Integration Ideas

### 1. Real-Time Metrics
- Tasks per agent per hour
- Average time in each status
- Blocker resolution time
- Quality gate pass rate

### 2. Visual Workflows
- Kanban board showing all agent tasks
- Gantt chart for multi-phase projects
- Network graph of agent interactions
- Heat map of busy/idle agents

## 🔐 Additional Benefits

1. **Audit Compliance**: Every decision tracked
2. **Learning Dataset**: Agent interactions for ML training
3. **Human Oversight**: Managers can intervene via Linear
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Works even if other systems fail
