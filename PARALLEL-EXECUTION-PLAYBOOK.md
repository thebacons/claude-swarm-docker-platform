# Parallel Execution Playbook for Claude Code

## Overview
This playbook documents best practices for leveraging Claude Code's parallel execution capabilities to dramatically improve efficiency and reduce time-to-completion for complex tasks.

## When to Use Parallel vs Sequential Execution

### Use Parallel Execution When:
1. **Multiple Independent Files**: Reading or analyzing files that don't depend on each other
2. **Information Gathering**: Searching for patterns, understanding codebases, or collecting data
3. **Batch Operations**: Performing similar operations on multiple targets
4. **Independent Verifications**: Running different types of checks or tests simultaneously
5. **Multi-Source Analysis**: Gathering information from different systems (files, git, web)

### Use Sequential Execution When:
1. **Dependent Operations**: When output from one operation is needed for the next
2. **File Modifications**: When editing files that might conflict with each other
3. **Ordered Workflows**: When tasks must be completed in a specific sequence
4. **State-Dependent Tasks**: When system state changes affect subsequent operations

## Best Practices We Learned

### 1. **Batch Similar Operations**
Instead of:
```
Read file A
Read file B
Read file C
```

Do:
```
Read files A, B, and C in parallel
```

**Real Example from Session:**
```python
# We read multiple playbook files simultaneously
- QUICK-SESSION-RECOVERY.md
- IMPLEMENTATION.md  
- WEB-UI-INSTRUCTIONS.md
- All in one parallel batch
```

### 2. **Combine Different Tool Types**
Claude Code can run different tools in parallel, not just the same tool multiple times.

**Real Example from Session:**
```python
# We ran these simultaneously:
- Bash (git status, git log)
- Read (multiple files)
- Grep (search operations)
```

### 3. **Strategic Information Gathering**
Start with broad parallel searches, then narrow down based on results.

**Real Example from Session:**
```python
# Phase 1: Broad search (parallel)
- Search for "IMPLEMENTATION" across codebase
- Search for "LINEAR" references
- Search for deployment files

# Phase 2: Targeted reads (parallel) based on findings
- Read specific implementation files found
- Read related configuration files
```

### 4. **Parallel Git Operations**
Git operations that don't modify state can run in parallel.

**Safe Parallel Git Operations:**
```bash
# These can all run simultaneously:
- git status
- git log
- git diff
- git branch -a
- git remote -v
```

## Common Patterns for Different Task Types

### Pattern 1: Codebase Understanding
```python
# Step 1: Parallel discovery
- Glob for file patterns (*.md, *.py, *.js)
- Search for key terms
- Read directory structures

# Step 2: Parallel deep dive
- Read all relevant files found
- Check git history for recent changes
- Search for specific patterns in code
```

### Pattern 2: Documentation Creation
```python
# Step 1: Parallel information gathering
- Read all related docs
- Search for references in code
- Check git commits for context

# Step 2: Sequential writing
- Create/update documentation based on gathered info
```

### Pattern 3: Testing and Verification
```python
# Parallel execution:
- Run different test suites
- Check multiple log files
- Verify different components
- Search for error patterns
```

### Pattern 4: Multi-Repository Operations
```python
# When working across multiple repos:
- Clone/pull all repos in parallel
- Search across all repos simultaneously
- Read similar files from each repo in batch
```

## How to Measure Effectiveness

### Time Metrics
1. **Sequential Time**: Sum of all operation times if run one-by-one
2. **Parallel Time**: Actual time taken with parallel execution
3. **Speedup Factor**: Sequential Time / Parallel Time

**Example from Our Session:**
```
Sequential estimate: 15-20 seconds (6-8 file reads @ 2-3 seconds each)
Parallel actual: ~3 seconds
Speedup factor: 5-7x
```

### Quality Metrics
1. **Completeness**: Did we gather all necessary information?
2. **Accuracy**: Were there any race conditions or conflicts?
3. **Context Preservation**: Did parallel execution maintain proper context?

### Efficiency Indicators
- **Token Usage**: Parallel execution uses similar tokens but delivers results faster
- **Iteration Reduction**: Fewer back-and-forth interactions needed
- **Decision Speed**: Faster access to information enables quicker decisions

## Specific Examples from Our Session

### Example 1: Implementation Discovery
**Task**: Find and understand the autonomous agent implementation

**Parallel Approach:**
```python
# Simultaneous operations:
1. Grep for "IMPLEMENTATION" patterns
2. Search for .ai-comm directory files  
3. Read QUICK-SESSION-RECOVERY.md
4. Check git status and recent commits

# Result: Found implementation details in <5 seconds vs ~20 seconds sequential
```

### Example 2: Linear Project Investigation
**Task**: Find Linear project details and implementation plans

**Parallel Approach:**
```python
# Batch 1:
- Search for "linear" in filenames
- Grep for "BAC-" patterns
- Read CLAUDE.md sections

# Batch 2: Based on findings
- Read specific implementation files
- Check related test results
- Review project documentation

# Result: Complete picture in 2 batches vs 10+ sequential operations
```

### Example 3: Creating This Playbook
**Task**: Document parallel execution best practices

**Approach:**
1. Parallel information gathering from our session
2. Sequential organization and writing
3. Parallel verification of examples

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. **Over-Parallelization**
Don't parallelize operations that are naturally sequential or when the overhead exceeds benefits.

### 2. **Ignoring Dependencies**
```python
# BAD: These have dependencies
- Create file A
- Read file A  
- Modify file A
# These must be sequential
```

### 3. **Resource Contention**
Be mindful of system resources when running many parallel operations.

### 4. **Context Loss**
Too many parallel operations can make it hard to maintain context. Batch related operations together.

## Quick Reference Guide

### High-Impact Parallel Patterns
```python
# 1. Multi-file reads
files = ["file1.md", "file2.py", "file3.json"]
# Read all simultaneously

# 2. Search combination  
# Run together:
- Glob("**/*.md")
- Grep("pattern", path="src/")
- LS("./docs")

# 3. Git information gathering
# Parallel safe:
- git status
- git log --oneline -10
- git branch -a
- git diff --stat

# 4. Cross-system checks
# Simultaneously:
- Read local files
- Check git history
- Search codebase
- Query external APIs
```

## Measuring Success

### Before Parallel Execution
- Time to understand codebase: 10-15 minutes
- Time to find specific information: 2-5 minutes
- Number of round trips: 5-10

### After Parallel Execution
- Time to understand codebase: 2-3 minutes
- Time to find specific information: 10-30 seconds
- Number of round trips: 1-3

### ROI Calculation
```
Time Saved = Sequential Time - Parallel Time
Efficiency Gain = (Time Saved / Sequential Time) Ã— 100%

Typical gains: 60-85% time reduction
```

## Conclusion

Parallel execution in Claude Code is a powerful capability that, when used correctly, can dramatically improve productivity. The key is identifying independent operations and batching them intelligently. Start with information gathering tasks, measure the improvements, and gradually expand to more complex parallel patterns as you become comfortable with the approach.

Remember: Not everything should be parallel, but when operations are truly independent, parallelization can provide 5-10x speedups with no loss in quality or accuracy.
