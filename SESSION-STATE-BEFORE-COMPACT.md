# Session State Before Auto-Compact

## Current Task: Getting PM Agent Opinion on Design Exercise

### What We Were Doing:
1. Created comprehensive design exercise documentation in Linear issue BAC-154
2. Fixed PM Agent's Linear access by adding enhanced wrapper script
3. Were trying to get PM Agent's opinion on the design exercise
4. PM Agent can see BAC-154 but needs to provide assessment

### Key Session Activities Completed:
1. **Parallel Execution Monitor Analysis**
   - Spawned 6 expert agents for triangulated analysis
   - Documented complete findings in BAC-154
   - Observer Agent provided retrospective
   - PM simulation provided cost analysis ($40-50k impact)

2. **Container Architecture Discussion**
   - Compared simulated PM vs container PM value
   - Fixed Linear integration in PM container
   - Created enhanced Linear wrapper with get-issue capability

3. **Current Status**:
   - Monitor server running on port 8000 (PID: 39282)
   - PM Agent container has Linear access working
   - BAC-154 fully documented with all analyses
   - Waiting for PM Agent's informed opinion

### Next Immediate Steps After Compact:
1. Get PM Agent's assessment using:
   ```bash
   docker exec casper-project-manager claude "Review BAC-154 and provide PM assessment"
   ```

2. Compare PM Agent's perspective with simulation
3. Document final conclusions about container vs simulation value
4. Decide on hybrid approach implementation

### Important Context:
- We discovered existing Linear issues: BAC-143 (monitoring dashboard already planned)
- Question raised: Do we need dedicated containers or is simulation sufficient?
- PM Agent needs to see why it wasn't involved from the start

### Commands Ready to Run:
```bash
# Check PM Agent can still access Linear
docker exec casper-project-manager /home/claude/workspace/scripts/linear-wrapper-enhanced.sh get-issue-by-identifier BAC-154

# Get PM Agent's opinion
docker exec casper-project-manager claude "As PM Agent, review the design exercise in BAC-154 and provide your assessment"
```

### Files Created This Session:
- `/scripts/linear-wrapper-enhanced.sh` - Enhanced Linear wrapper with get-issue capability
- `SESSION-STATE-BEFORE-COMPACT.md` - This file

### Container Status:
- casper-project-manager: Running (12+ hours)
- Has Linear API access via enhanced wrapper
- Ready to provide assessment
