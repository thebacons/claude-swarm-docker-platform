# Docker MCP Toolkit vs Our Approach - Key Differences

## What the Video Shows (Docker MCP Toolkit)

### Architecture
```
Claude Desktop → Docker Desktop → MCP Containers
(on host)        (MCP Toolkit)    (isolated servers)
```

### How Docker MCP Toolkit Works
1. **MCP servers run in separate containers** - Each MCP server is its own Docker container
2. **Docker Desktop acts as broker** - Uses socat to bridge between Claude Desktop and containers
3. **Configuration via Docker Desktop** - Auto-configures Claude Desktop's config file
4. **TCP communication** - Uses `host.docker.internal:8811` for inter-container communication

Example configuration they use:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MCP_DOCKER": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "alpine/socat", "STDIO", "TCP:host.docker.internal:8811"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Our Approach (Claude Code IN Container)

### Architecture
```
Container
├── Claude Code (installed inside)
├── MCP servers (trying to run inside)
└── Bash wrappers (fallback)
```

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Docker MCP Toolkit | Our Approach |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Claude Location | Desktop (host) | Inside container |
| MCP Servers | Separate containers | Same container |
| Communication | TCP via Docker | stdio (broken) |
| Persistence | Docker manages | No persistence |
| Configuration | Auto via Docker Desktop | Manual .mcp.json |

## Why They Got It Working

1. **Claude Desktop on host** - Not containerized, has full system access
2. **MCP servers in containers** - Each server isolated but accessible via TCP
3. **Docker Desktop broker** - Handles the persistent connections
4. **Socat bridge** - Translates stdio to TCP, maintaining connections

## Why Our Approach Struggles

1. **Claude Code containerized** - Limited to container environment
2. **stdio transport** - Requires persistent processes we can't maintain
3. **No broker layer** - Direct stdio connections die immediately
4. **Stateless execution** - Each `claude` command is fresh

## The Solution Path

### Option 1: Adopt Docker MCP Toolkit Pattern
- Run MCP servers as separate containers
- Use TCP communication instead of stdio
- Implement socat bridges in our containers

### Option 2: Implement Our MCP Broker
- As proposed in previous plan
- Acts like Docker Desktop's role
- Maintains persistent connections

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Keep bash wrappers for now
- Add Docker MCP Toolkit for Claude Desktop users
- Our containers use wrappers internally

## Key Insight

The video's approach works because:
- **Claude Desktop** (host) → **Docker containers** (MCP servers)

Our approach fails because:
- **Claude Code** (container) → **MCP servers** (same container, no persistence)

The fundamental difference is that they're not trying to run Claude Code inside a container - they're using containers only for MCP servers while Claude Desktop runs on the host with full system capabilities.
