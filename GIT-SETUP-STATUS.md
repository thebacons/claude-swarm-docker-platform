4. Private repository: Yes
5. Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Create repository

### 2. Push to GitHub
After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/colin/Documents-local/91_Claude-Code/claude-swarm-docker-spawn

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/thebacons/claude-swarm-docker-platform.git

# Push main branch
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Create Feature Branch for Docker Work
```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch for BAC-151
git checkout -b feature/bac-151-docker-container-base

# Future work will be done on feature branches
```

### 4. Configure Branch Protection (on GitHub)
