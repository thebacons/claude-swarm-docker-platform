# CASPER Parallel Execution Monitor

## 🎯 Overview

An animated web dashboard that provides real-time visibility into the CASPER multi-agent parallel execution system. This solves your visibility problem by showing exactly what each agent and subagent is doing during parallel task execution.

## 🚀 Features

### Visual Elements

1. **Network Topology Visualization**
   - Shows all 6 CASPER agents (PM, Policeman, Dev-1, Dev-2, Tester, Observer)
   - Animated message flow between agents
   - Visual indication of active agents

2. **Agent Status Panel**
   - Real-time status for each agent (Active/Busy/Idle)
   - Expandable list of subagents for each main agent
   - Shows current subagent count (up to 10 per agent)

3. **Active Parallel Tasks**
   - Visual cards for each running task
   - Progress bars with smooth animations
   - Shows which subagent is handling each task

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Total parallel agents running
   - Tasks per second throughput
   - Speedup factor vs sequential
   - Overall efficiency percentage

5. **Live Activity Log**
   - Scrolling log window with color-coded entries
   - Real-time updates as agents work
   - Timestamps for each action

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to the monitor directory
cd parallel-execution-monitor

# Start a simple HTTP server (Python 3)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

### Integration with CASPER

To connect this to real CASPER execution:

1. **Add WebSocket Server** to Observer Agent:
```python
# In Observer Agent
import asyncio
import websockets

class MonitorBroadcaster:
    def __init__(self):
        self.clients = set()
    
    async def broadcast(self, message):
        if self.clients:
            await asyncio.gather(
                *[client.send(message) for client in self.clients]
            )
```

2. **Send Real-Time Updates**:
```python
# When Task tool is invoked
await monitor.broadcast({
    "type": "task_start",
    "agent": "Developer-1",
    "subagent": 3,
    "task": "Fix Model Routing",
    "timestamp": time.time()
})
```

3. **Update Dashboard** to connect to WebSocket:
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8765');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    updateDashboard(data);
};
```

## 📊 What You Can Monitor

### During Parallel Execution

1. **Task Distribution**
   - See which agent gets which task
   - Watch subagents spawn in real-time
   - Track task assignments

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Visual progress bars for each task
   - Completion notifications
   - Time-to-completion estimates

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Compare parallel vs sequential times
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Monitor resource utilization

4. **Error Detection**
   - Red alerts for failures
   - Warning indicators for slowdowns
   - Pattern recognition by Observer

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding More Agents
```javascript
// In the HTML, add new agent node
<div class="agent-node node-custom" 
     style="background: linear-gradient(45deg, #ff6b6b, #c92a2a);">
    Custom Agent
</div>
```

### Modifying Animations
```css
/* Change animation speed */
.message-dot {
    animation: move 2s infinite; /* Adjust duration */
}

/* Change colors */
.status-active { 
    background: #your-color; 
}
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### 1. Task Filtering
- Click on an agent to see only its tasks
- Filter by task type or status
- Search for specific operations

### 2. Historical Playback
- Record entire sessions
- Replay at different speeds
- Analyze patterns over time

### 3. Export Capabilities
- Download logs as CSV
- Export performance metrics
- Generate reports

## 🚦 Visual Indicators

- **Green**: Active and healthy
- **Yellow**: Busy or warning
- **Red**: Error or blocked
- **Blue**: Information/normal operation
- **Purple**: Subagent activity
