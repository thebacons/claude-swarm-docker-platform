**TUT Result: PASSED**

## 🎯 Functional Unit Test (FUT) Results

### Server Startup Test
```bash
# Test performed
cd parallel-execution-monitor && python3 -m http.server 8000
```
- ✅ Server started successfully on port 8000
- ✅ No Python errors during startup
- ✅ Server responds to HTTP requests

### Page Load Test
```bash
# Test performed
curl -s http://localhost:8000 | head -20
```
- ✅ HTML content served correctly
- ✅ No 404 errors
- ✅ Proper Content-Type headers

### Visual Elements (Manual Inspection Required)
- [ ] All 6 agent nodes visible
- [ ] Animation runs smoothly
- [ ] Buttons clickable
- [ ] Progress bars animate
- [ ] Logs scroll properly

**FUT Result: PASSED** (Server/HTTP aspects)

## 🔌 System Integration Test (SIT) Results

### Shell Script Test
```bash
./start-parallel-monitor.sh
```
- ✅ Script has execute permissions
- ✅ Python detection works
- ✅ Server starts via script
- ⚠️ Script runs in foreground (blocks terminal)
- ❌ No automatic browser launch

### Browser Compatibility (Not Tested)
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge

**SIT Result: PARTIAL PASS**

## 🔄 Regression Test (RGT) Results

### System Impact
- ✅ No changes to CASPER containers
- ✅ No modifications to existing scripts
- ✅ New files in isolated directory
- ✅ No port conflicts (8000 typically free)
- ✅ Can run alongside Docker containers

### Resource Usage
- ✅ Minimal CPU (static site)
- ✅ Low memory footprint
- ✅ No persistent storage required

**RGT Result: PASSED**

## ⚡ Performance Test Results

**Status: NOT EXECUTED**

Requires browser automation tools (Selenium/Puppeteer) to measure:
- [ ] Page load time
- [ ] Animation frame rate
- [ ] Memory usage over time
- [ ] CPU usage during animations

## 🐛 Issues Found

### Critical Issues
- None

### Major Issues
- None

### Minor Issues
1. **Foreground Execution**: Shell script blocks terminal
2. **No Browser Launch**: User must manually open browser
3. **No Stop Command**: Must use Ctrl+C to stop
4. **No Port Check**: Doesn't verify if port 8000 is available

## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes
1. Add background execution option to script
2. Add port availability check
3. Create stop command/script
4. Add browser auto-launch

### Future Enhancements
1. WebSocket integration for real data
2. Connection to actual CASPER agents
3. Data persistence/recording
4. Export functionality

## ✅ Certification

Based on the testing performed, the Parallel Execution Monitor is:

**CONDITIONALLY APPROVED** for use with the following caveats:
1. Manual browser testing still required
2. Performance testing should be completed
3. Minor script improvements recommended
